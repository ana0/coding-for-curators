1. Pocket Garden

Pocket Garden is a generative audio-visual ecosystem that evolves from users’ spoken words. Visitors speak into their device's microphone, and the software translates their speech patterns into seeds that grow into abstract, living forms—each shaped by tone, rhythm, and emotional inflection. As they walk around the gallery, the plant in their pocket senses their movements and takes shape based on how they explore the exhibition. But everything is temporary, and as they leave the gallery, the plant starts to decay. By the time they have disconnected from it's wifi, there will be only a small patch of compost waiting for their next visit.

2. Soft Error

Soft Error is an interactive, self-corrupting software environment that intentionally blurs the line between functionality and failure. The interface appears as a minimalist operating system, but every user action—opening a window, typing a command—introduces a subtle glitch that permanently alters the system. Over time, menus drift, text fragments reassemble into poetic nonsense, and visuals disintegrate into shifting code artifacts. The artwork behaves like a sentient machine suffering from memory decay, reflecting on digital fragility and the aesthetics of entropy through the user’s own interactions.

3. Commonplace Engine

In Commonplace Engine, users collectively write an endless, evolving digital book. Each participant can contribute a short passage, image, or fragment, which the software integrates into an ever-reordering text according to semantic relationships and emotional tone analysis. The system “reads” the entire corpus constantly, generating new connections and erasing or merging redundant ideas. Users can navigate the work through associative browsing rather than linear reading, encountering shifting constellations of meaning. The behaviour of the piece reveals a living archive of collective thought—never fixed, always rewriting itself.

4. Forecast Bodies

Forecast Bodies is a networked artwork that merges live meteorological data with human gesture. The software draws on global weather feeds—temperature, humidity, wind speed—and translates them into an evolving visual field projected in the gallery: drifting clouds of color and form. Viewers can influence the system through slow movements captured by cameras; each gesture introduces microclimates—gusts of digital wind, pockets of heat, or precipitation-like pixel streams. The work behaves as a responsive atmosphere, where local bodily presence collides with planetary weather systems, creating a meditative dialogue between human motion and environmental flux.

5. Whisper Network

Whisper Network is a participatory messaging artwork where visitors are matched with each other and encourages to have anonymous, ephemeral conversations. Users type messages that can only be read by one other unseen participant. Users are paired randomly, but system prompts invite them into conversation probing questions. Sentiment analysis runs on each exchange, which subtly reshapes the running visuals and soundscape: calm tones for empathy, static for hostility, fading light for silence. When the conversation ends, the visuals and sonic changes induced by participants gradually reset to zero. The work behaves as a fragile social organism, sustained only by the secrecy and vulnerability of its users.
